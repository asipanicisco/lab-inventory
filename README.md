### Common Issues

1. **"NaN" Asset IDs**
   - The system automatically fixes these on load
   - If persists, use "Reload from File" in Data Management

2. **Import Failures**
   - Check CSV column names match exactly
   - Ensure locations are SF, SJ, RTP, or BGL
   - Verify categories match supported types
   - Check for required fields based on category

3. **Duplicate Serial Numbers**
   - System prevents importing assets with duplicate serials
   - Check the duplicate report after import
   - Remove or update existing assets before re-importing

4. **Data Not Saving**
   - Check file permissions for `inventory_data.json`
   - Ensure sufficient disk space
   - Try manual save in Data Management tab

### Asset ID Format
- Legacy format: `AST-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS###`
- New format: `AST-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-MICROSECONDS-XXXX`
- Both formats are supported

## üìä Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**: Export CSV backups regularly
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for assets
3. **Complete Information**: Fill in all required fields for better tracking
4. **Serial Numbers**: Always include serial numbers to prevent duplicates
5. **Owner Assignment**: Assign owners to track responsibility
6. **Status Updates**: Keep deployment and loan status current
